/**
 * @file
 *
 * SipHash is a family of pseudorandom functions (PRFs) optimized for speed on short messages.
 *
 * SipHash was designed in 2012 by Jean-Philippe Aumasson and Daniel J. Bernstein as a defense
 * against hash-flooding DoS attacks.
 *
 * SipHash is simpler and faster on short messages than previous cryptographic algorithms,
 * such as MACs based on universal hashing.
 * Competitive in performance with insecure non-cryptographic algorithms.
 *
 * Cryptographically secure, with no sign of weakness despite multiple cryptanalysis projects
 * by leading cryptographers.
 *
 * Battle-tested, with successful integration in OSs (Linux kernel, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, FreeRTOS),
 * languages (Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.), libraries (OpenSSL libcrypto, Sodium, etc.)
 * and applications (Wireguard, Redis, etc.).
 *
 * As a secure pseudorandom function (a.k.a. keyed hash function), SipHash can also be used as
 * a secure message authentication code (MAC). But SipHash is not a hash in the sense of
 * general-purpose key-less hash function such as BLAKE3 or SHA-3.
 * SipHash should therefore always be used with a secret key in order to be secure.
