/**
 * @file
 * Shared tbl8 pool for FIB backends.
 *
 * A tbl8 pool manages a shared array of tbl8 groups that can be used
 * across multiple FIB instances (e.g., one per VRF).
 *
 * Two modes of operation:
 *  - Internal pool: set num_tbl8 in the FIB config and leave tbl8_pool
 *    NULL. The pool is created and destroyed with the FIB.
 *  - External shared pool: create with rte_fib_tbl8_pool_create(), pass
 *    the handle via the tbl8_pool config field. Each FIB holds a
 *    reference; the creator releases its reference with
 *    rte_fib_tbl8_pool_free(). The pool is freed when the last
 *    reference is dropped.
 *
 * Thread safety: none. The pool is not thread-safe. All operations
 * on FIBs sharing the same pool (route updates, FIB creation and
 * destruction, pool create/free) must be serialized by the caller.
