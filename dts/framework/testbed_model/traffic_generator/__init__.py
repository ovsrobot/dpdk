"""DTS traffic generators.

A traffic generator is capable of generating traffic and then monitor returning traffic.
A traffic generator may just count the number of received packets
and it may additionally capture individual packets.

A traffic generator may be software running on generic hardware or it could be specialized hardware.

The traffic generators that only count the number of received packets are suitable only for
performance testing. In functional testing, we need to be able to dissect each arrived packet
and a capturing traffic generator is required.
