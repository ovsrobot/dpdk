"""Common functionality for interactive shell handling.

The base class, :class:`InteractiveShell`, is meant to be extended by subclasses that contain
functionality specific to that shell type. These subclasses will often modify things like
the prompt to expect or the arguments to pass into the application, but still utilize
the same method for sending a command and collecting output. How this output is handled however
is often application specific. If an application needs elevated privileges to start it is expected
that the method for gaining those privileges is provided when initializing the class.

The :option:`--timeout` command line argument and the :envvar:`DTS_TIMEOUT`
environment variable configure the timeout of getting the output from command execution.
