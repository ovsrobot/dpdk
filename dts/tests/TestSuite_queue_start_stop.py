"""Rx/Tx queue start and stop functionality suite.

This suite tests the ability of the poll mode driver to start and
stop either the Rx or Tx queue (depending on the port) during runtime,
and verify that packets are not received when one is disabled.

Given a paired port topology, the Rx queue will be disabled on port 0,
and the Tx queue will be disabled on port 1.
