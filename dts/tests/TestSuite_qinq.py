"""QinQ (802.1ad) Test Suite.

This test suite verifies the correctness and capability of DPDK Poll Mode Drivers (PMDs)
in handling QinQ-tagged Ethernet frames, which contain a pair of stacked VLAN headers
(outer S-VLAN and inner C-VLAN). These tests ensure that both software and hardware offloads
related to QinQ behave as expected across different NIC vendors and PMD implementations.
