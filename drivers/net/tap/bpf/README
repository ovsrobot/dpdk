This is the BPF program used to implement the RSS across queues
flow action. It works like the skbedit tc filter but instead of mapping
to only one queues, it maps to multiple queues based on RSS hash.

This version is built the BPF Compile Once â€” Run Everywhere (CO-RE)
framework and uses libbpf and bpftool.

Limitations
- requires libbpf version XX or later
- rebuilding the BPF requires clang and bpftool
- only Toeplitz hash with standard 40 byte key is supported
- the number of queues per RSS action is limited to 16
