For many platforms, compiling and installing DPDK should work using the
following set of commands::

	meson build
	cd build
	ninja
	ninja install

This will compile DPDK in the ``build`` subdirectory, and then install the
resulting libraries, drivers and header files onto the system - generally
in /usr/local. A package-config file, ``libdpdk.pc``,  for DPDK will also
be installed to allow ease of compiling and linking with applications.

After installation, to use DPDK, the necessary CFLAG and LDFLAG variables
can be got from pkg-config::

	pkg-config --cflags libdpdk
	pkg-config --libs libdpdk

More detail on each of these steps can be got from the
"Installing DPDK Using the meson build system" section of the programming guides.
