HISILICON Accelerator DMA Driver
================================

Kunpeng SoC has an internal accelerator unit which includes zip function, and
the zip also supports data copy and fill. This driver exposes this capability to
DPDK application.


Supported Kunpeng SoCs
----------------------

* Kunpeng 920


Device Setup
-------------

In order to use the device in DPDK, user should insmod uacce.ko, hisi_qm.ko and
hisi_zip.ko(with module parameter uacce_mode=1), then there will be several
subdirectories whose names start with hisi_zip in /sys/class/uacce/ directory.

Device Probing and Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User should use following method to probe device::

        $ dpdk-app -a uacce:hisi_zip-0,queues=2 ...

hisi_zip-0 is the directory name in the /sys/class/uacce/ directory, queues is
runtime config parameter which indicates how many dmadevs are created.

If the probe is successful, two dmadevs are created, named "hisi_zip-0-dma0"
and "hisi_zip-0-dma1".

.. note::
        In the /sys/class/uacce/hisi_zip-x/ directory, user could query api and
        algorithms, this driver can only match the device whose api is
        hisi_qm_v5 and algorithms contain udma.

Device Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuration requirements:

* ``ring_size`` obtain from UACCE API and is a fixed value.
* Only one ``vchan`` is supported per ``dmadev``.
* Silent mode is not supported.
* The transfer direction must be set to ``RTE_DMA_DIR_MEM_TO_MEM``.


Device Datapath Capability and Limitation
-----------------------------------------

Support memory copy and fill operations.

.. note::
        Currently, the maximum size of the operation data is limited to 16MB-1B
        in the driver. The device actually supports operations in a larger data
        size, but the driver requires complex operations in the datapth. If you
        have such requirement, please contact the maintainers.
