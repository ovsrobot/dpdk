Marvell cnxk SSO Eventdev Driver
================================

The SSO PMD (**librte_event_cnxk**) and provides poll mode
eventdev driver support for the inbuilt event device found in the
**Marvell OCTEON cnxk** SoC family.

More information about OCTEON cnxk SoC can be found at `Marvell Official Website
<https://www.marvell.com/embedded-processors/infrastructure-processors/>`_.

Supported OCTEON cnxk SoCs
--------------------------

- CN9XX
- CN10XX

Features
--------

Features of the OCTEON cnxk SSO PMD are:

- 256 Event queues
- 26 (dual) and 52 (single) Event ports on CN9XX
- 52 Event ports on CN10XX
- HW event scheduler
- Supports 1M flows per event queue
- Flow based event pipelining
- Flow pinning support in flow based event pipelining
- Queue based event pipelining
- Supports ATOMIC, ORDERED, PARALLEL schedule types per flow
- Event scheduling QoS based on event queue priority
- Open system with configurable amount of outstanding events limited only by
  DRAM
- HW accelerated dequeue timeout support to enable power management

Prerequisites and Compilation procedure
---------------------------------------

   See :doc:`../platform/cnxk` for setup information.


Runtime Config Options
----------------------

- ``Maximum number of in-flight events`` (default ``8192``)

  In **Marvell OCTEON cnxk** the max number of in-flight events are only limited
  by DRAM size, the ``xae_cnt`` devargs parameter is introduced to provide
  upper limit for in-flight events.

  For example::

    -a 0002:0e:00.0,xae_cnt=16384
