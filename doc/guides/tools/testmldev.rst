dpdk-test-mldev Application
===========================

The ``dpdk-test-mldev`` tool is a Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) application that allows testing
various mldev use cases. This application has a generic framework to add new mldev based test cases
to verify functionality and measure the performance of inference execution on DPDK ML devices.


Application and Options
-----------------------

The application has a number of command line options:

.. code-block:: console

   dpdk-test-mldev [EAL Options] -- [application options]

EAL Options
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following are the EAL command-line options that can be used with the ``dpdk-test-mldev``
application. See the DPDK Getting Started Guides for more information on these options.

*   ``-c <COREMASK>`` or ``-l <CORELIST>``

        Set the hexadecimal bitmask of the cores to run on. The corelist is a list of cores to use.

*   ``-a <PCI_ID>``

        Attach a PCI based ML device. Specific to drivers using a PCI based ML devices.

*   ``--vdev <driver>``

        Add a virtual mldev device. Specific to drivers using a ML virtual device.


Application Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following are the command-line options supported by the test application.

* ``--test <name>``

        Name of the test to execute.

* ``--dev_id <n>``

        Set the device id of the ML device to be used for the test. Default value is `0`.

* ``--socket_id <n>``

        Set the socket id of the application resources. Default value is `SOCKET_ID_ANY`.

* ``--debug``

        Enable the tests to run in debug mode.

* ``--help``

        Print help message.


Debug mode
----------

ML tests can be executed in debug mode by enabling the option ``--debug``. Execution of tests in
debug mode would enable additional prints.
