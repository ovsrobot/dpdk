dpdk-test-mldev Application
===========================

The ``dpdk-test-mldev`` tool is a Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) application that allows testing
various mldev use cases. This application has a generic framework to add new mldev based test cases
to verify functionality and measure the performance of inference execution on DPDK ML devices.


Application and Options
-----------------------

The application has a number of command line options:

.. code-block:: console

   dpdk-test-mldev [EAL Options] -- [application options]

EAL Options
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following are the EAL command-line options that can be used with the ``dpdk-test-mldev``
application. See the DPDK Getting Started Guides for more information on these options.

*   ``-c <COREMASK>`` or ``-l <CORELIST>``

        Set the hexadecimal bitmask of the cores to run on. The corelist is a list of cores to use.

*   ``-a <PCI_ID>``

        Attach a PCI based ML device. Specific to drivers using a PCI based ML devices.

*   ``--vdev <driver>``

        Add a virtual mldev device. Specific to drivers using a ML virtual device.


Application Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following are the command-line options supported by the test application.

* ``--test <name>``

        Name of the test to execute. ML tests are divided into two groups, Device and Model
        tests. Test name should be one of the following supported tests.

      **ML Device Tests** ::

         device_ops

      **ML Model Tests** ::

         model_ops

* ``--dev_id <n>``

        Set the device id of the ML device to be used for the test. Default value is `0`.

* ``--socket_id <n>``

        Set the socket id of the application resources. Default value is `SOCKET_ID_ANY`.

* ``--models <model_list>``

        Set the list of model files to be used for the tests. Application expects the
        ``model_list`` in comma separated form (i.e. ``--models model_A.bin,model_B.bin``).
        Maximum number of models supported by the test is ``8``.

* ``--debug``

        Enable the tests to run in debug mode.

* ``--help``

        Print help message.


ML Device Tests
-------------------------

ML device tests are functional tests to validate ML device APIs. Device tests validate the ML device
handling APIs configure, close, start and stop APIs.


Application Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Supported command line options for the `device_ops` test are following::

        --debug
        --test
        --dev_id
        --socket_id


DEVICE_OPS Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Device ops test validates the device configuration and reconfiguration.


Example
^^^^^^^

Command to run device_ops test:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo <build_dir>/app/dpdk-test-mldev -c 0xf -a <PCI_ID> -- \
        --test=device_ops


ML Model Tests
-------------------------

Model tests are functional tests to validate ML model APIs. Model tests validate the functioning
of APIs to load, start, stop and unload ML models.


Application Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Supported command line options for the `model_ops` test are following::

        --debug
        --test
        --dev_id
        --socket_id
        --models


List of model files to be used for the `model_ops` test can be specified through the option
``--models <model_list>`` as a comma separated list. Maximum number of models supported in
the test is `8`.

.. Note::

    * The ``--models <model_list>`` is a mandatory option for running this test.
    * Options not supported by the test are ignored if specified.


MODEL_OPS Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The test is a collection of multiple sub-tests, each with a different order of slow-path
operations when handling with `N` number of models.


**Sub-test A:** executes the sequence of load / start / stop / unload for a model in order,
followed by next model.
.. _figure_mldev_model_ops_subtest_a:

.. figure:: img/mldev_model_ops_subtest_a.*

   Execution sequence of model_ops subtest A.


**Sub-test B:** executes load for all models, followed by a start for all models. Upon successful
start of all models, stop is invoked for all models followed by unload.
.. _figure_mldev_model_ops_subtest_b:

.. figure:: img/mldev_model_ops_subtest_b.*

   Execution sequence of model_ops subtest B.


**Sub-test C:** loads all models, followed by a start and stop of all models in order. Upon
completion of stop, unload is invoked for all models.
.. _figure_mldev_model_ops_subtest_c:

.. figure:: img/mldev_model_ops_subtest_c.*

   Execution sequence of model_ops subtest C.


**Sub-test D:** executes load and start for all models available. Upon successful start of all
models, stop and stop is executed for the models.
.. _figure_mldev_model_ops_subtest_d:

.. figure:: img/mldev_model_ops_subtest_d.*

   Execution sequence of model_ops subtest D.


Example
^^^^^^^

Command to run model_ops test:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo <build_dir>/app/dpdk-test-mldev -c 0xf -a <PCI_ID> -- \
        --test=model_ops --models model_1.bin,model_2.bin,model_3.bin, model_4.bin


Debug mode
----------

ML tests can be executed in debug mode by enabling the option ``--debug``. Execution of tests in
debug mode would enable additional prints.
