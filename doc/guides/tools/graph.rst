dpdk-graph Application
======================

The ``dpdk-graph`` tool is a Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK)
application that allows exercising various graph use cases.
This application has a generic framework to add new graph based use cases to
verify functionality. Each use case is defined as a ``<usecase>.cli`` file.
Based on the input file, application creates a graph to cater the use case.

Also this application framework can be used by other graph based applications.

Running the Application
-----------------------

The application has a number of command line options which can be provided in
following syntax

.. code-block:: console

   dpdk-graph [EAL Options] -- [application options]

EAL Options
~~~~~~~~~~~

Following are the EAL command-line options that can be used in conjunction
with the ``dpdk-graph`` application.
See the DPDK Getting Started Guides for more information on these options.

*   ``-c <COREMASK>`` or ``-l <CORELIST>``

        Set the hexadecimal bit mask of the cores to run on. The CORELIST is a
        list of cores to be used.

Application Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following are the application command-line options:

* ``-s``

        Script name with absolute path which specifies the use case. It is
        a mandatory parameter which will be used to create desired graph
        for a given use case.

* ``--help``

       Dumps application usage

Supported CLI commands
----------------------

This section provides details on commands which can be used in ``<usecase>.cli``
file to express the requested use case configuration.

.. list-table:: Exposed CLIs
   :widths: 40 40 10 10
