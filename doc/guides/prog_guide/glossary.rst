   Cyclic Redundancy Check
   An algorithm that detects errors in data transmission and storage.

Data Plane
   In contrast to the control plane, which is responsible for setting up and managing data connections,
   the `data plane <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_plane>`_ in a network architecture includes the
   layers involved when processing and forwarding data packets between communicating endpoints.
   These layers must be highly optimized to achieve good performance.

EAL
   :doc:`Environment Abstraction Layer (EAL) <env_abstraction_layer>`
   is a the core DPDK library that provides a generic interface
   that hides the environment specifics from the applications and libraries.
   The services expected from the EAL are: loading and launching, core management,
   memory allocation, bus management, and inter-partition communication.

EAL Thread
   An EAL thread is typically a thread that runs packet processing tasks. These threads are often
   pinned to logical cores (lcores), which helps to ensure that packet processing tasks are executed with
   minimal interruption and maximal performance by utilizing specific CPU resources dedicated to those tasks.
   EAL threads can also handle other tasks like managing buffers, queues, and I/O operations.

FIFO
   `First In First Out (FIFO) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)>`_
   is a method for organizing the manipulation of a data structure where the oldest (first) entry, or
   "head" of the queue, is processed first.

   reference on x86 platforms.

Huge Pages
   `Huge pages <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.html>`_
   are memory page sizes, larger than the default page size, which are supported by the host CPU.
   These pages are generally megabytes or even a gigabytes in size,  depending on platform,
   compared to the default page size on most platforms which is measured in kilobytes, e.g. 4k.
   Where the operating system provides access to hugepage memory, DPDK will take advantage of
   those hugepages for increased performance.
