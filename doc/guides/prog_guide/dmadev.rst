DMA Device Library
==================

The DMA library provides a DMA device framework for management and provisioning
of hardware and software DMA poll mode drivers, defining generic APIs which
support a number of different DMA operations.


Design Principles
-----------------

The DMA library follows the same basic principles as those used in DPDK's
Ethernet Device framework and the RegEx framework. The DMA framework provides
a generic DMA device framework which supports both physical (hardware)
and virtual (software) DMA devices as well as a generic DMA API which allows
DMA devices to be managed and configured and supports DMA operations to be
provisioned on DMA poll mode driver.

The above figure shows the model on which the DMA framework is built on:

 * The DMA controller could have multiple hardware DMA channels (aka. hardware
   DMA queues), each hardware DMA channel should be represented by a dmadev.
 * The dmadev could create multiple virtual DMA channels, each virtual DMA
   channel represents a different transfer context. The DMA operation request
   must be submitted to the virtual DMA channel. e.g. Application could create
   virtual DMA channel 0 for memory-to-memory transfer scenario, and create
   virtual DMA channel 1 for memory-to-device transfer scenario.


Device Management
-----------------

Device Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Physical DMA controllers are discovered during the PCI probe/enumeration of the
EAL function which is executed at DPDK initialization, this is based on their
PCI BDF (bus/bridge, device, function). Specific physical DMA controllers, like
other physical devices in DPDK can be listed using the EAL command line options.

The dmadevs are dynamically allocated by using the API
``rte_dma_pmd_allocate`` based on the number of hardware DMA channels. After the
dmadev initialized successfully, the driver needs to switch the dmadev state to
``RTE_DMA_DEV_READY``.


Device Identification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each DMA device, whether physical or virtual is uniquely designated by two
identifiers:

- A unique device index used to designate the DMA device in all functions
  exported by the DMA API.

- A device name used to designate the DMA device in console messages, for
  administration or debugging purposes.
