Removed Items
-------------

.. This section should contain removed items in this release. Sample format:

   * Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the removed item
     in the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* Removed support for Intel DLB V1 hardware. This is not a broad market device,
  and existing customers already obtain the source code directly from Intel.


API Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain API changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the API change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* eal: The experimental TLS API added in ``rte_thread.h`` has been renamed
  from ``rte_thread_tls_*`` to ``rte_thread_*`` to avoid naming redundancy
  and confusion with the transport layer security term.

* pci: The value ``PCI_ANY_ID`` is marked as deprecated
  and can be replaced with ``RTE_PCI_ANY_ID``.

* ethdev: Added a ``rte_flow`` pointer parameter to the function
  ``rte_flow_dev_dump()`` allowing dump for single flow.

* cryptodev: The experimental raw data path API for dequeue
  ``rte_cryptodev_raw_dequeue_burst`` got a new parameter
  ``max_nb_to_dequeue`` to provide flexible control on dequeue.

* ethdev: The experimental flow API for shared action has been generalized
  as a flow action handle used in rules through an indirect action.
  The functions ``rte_flow_shared_action_*`` manipulating the action object
  are replaced with ``rte_flow_action_handle_*``.
  The action ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_SHARED`` is deprecated and can be
  replaced with ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_INDIRECT``.

* ethdev: The experimental function ``rte_mtr_policer_actions_update()``,
  the enum ``rte_mtr_policer_action``, and the struct members
  ``policer_action_recolor_supported`` and ``policer_action_drop_supported``
  have been removed.

* stack: Lock-free ``rte_stack`` no longer silently ignores push and pop when
  it's not supported on the current platform. Instead ``rte_stack_create()``
  fails and ``rte_errno`` is set to ``ENOTSUP``.

* raw/ioat: The experimental function ``rte_ioat_completed_ops()`` now
  supports two additional parameters, ``status`` and ``num_unsuccessful``,
  to allow the reporting of errors from hardware when performing copy
  operations.


ABI Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain ABI changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the ABI change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* No ABI change that would break compatibility with 20.11.

* The experimental function ``rte_telemetry_legacy_register`` has been
  removed from the public API and is now an internal-only function. This
  function was already marked as internal in the API documentation for it,
  and was not for use by external applications.


Known Issues
------------

.. This section should contain new known issues in this release. Sample format:

   * **Add title in present tense with full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the known issue
