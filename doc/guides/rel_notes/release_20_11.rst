  See the :doc:`../regexdevs/octeontx2` for more details.

* **Updated ioat rawdev driver**

  The ioat rawdev driver has been updated and enhanced. Changes include:

  * Added support for Intel\ |reg| Data Streaming Accelerator hardware.
    For more information, see https://01.org/blogs/2019/introducing-intel-data-streaming-accelerator
  * Added support for the fill operation via the API ``rte_ioat_enqueue_fill()``,
    where the hardware fills an area of memory with a repeating pattern.
  * Added a per-device configuration flag to disable management
    of user-provided completion handles.
  * Renamed the ``rte_ioat_do_copies()`` API to ``rte_ioat_perform_ops()``,
    and renamed the ``rte_ioat_completed_copies()`` API to ``rte_ioat_completed_ops()``
    to better reflect the APIs' purposes, and remove the implication that
    they are limited to copy operations only.
    [Note: The old API is still provided but marked as deprecated in the code]
  * Added a new API ``rte_ioat_fence()`` to add a fence between operations.
    This API replaces the ``fence`` flag parameter in the ``rte_ioat_enqueue_copies()`` function,
    and is clearer as there is no ambiguity as to whether the flag should be
    set on the last operation before the fence or the first operation after it.

* **Updated the pipeline library for alignment with the P4 language.**

  Added new Software Switch (SWX) pipeline type that provides more
  flexibility through API and feature alignment with the P4 language.

  * The packet headers, meta-data, actions, tables and pipelines are
    dynamically defined instead of selected from pre-defined set.
  * The actions and the pipeline are defined with instructions.
  * Extern objects and functions can be plugged into the pipeline.
  * Transaction-oriented table updates.

* **Add new AVX512 specific classify algorithms for ACL library.**

  * Added new ``RTE_ACL_CLASSIFY_AVX512X16`` vector implementation,
    which can process up to 16 flows in parallel. Requires AVX512 support.

  * Added new ``RTE_ACL_CLASSIFY_AVX512X32`` vector implementation,
    which can process up to 32 flows in parallel. Requires AVX512 support.

* **Added support to update subport bandwidth dynamically.**

   * Added new API ``rte_sched_port_subport_profile_add`` to add new
     subport bandwidth profile to subport porfile table at runtime.

   * Added support to update subport rate dynamically.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* build macros: The macros defining ``RTE_MACHINE_CPUFLAG_*`` are removed.
  The information provided by these macros is available through standard
  compiler macros.

* eal: The ``rte_logs`` struct and global symbol was made private
  and is no longer part of the API.

* eal: Made the ``rte_dev_event`` structure private to the EAL as no public API
  used it.

* eal: ``rte_cio_rmb()`` and ``rte_cio_wmb()`` were deprecated since 20.08
  and are removed in this release.

* mem: Removed the unioned field ``phys_addr`` from
  the structures ``rte_memseg`` and ``rte_memzone``.
  The field ``iova`` is remaining from the old unions.

* mempool: Removed the unioned fields ``phys_addr`` and ``physaddr`` from
  the structures ``rte_mempool_memhdr`` and ``rte_mempool_objhdr``.
  The field ``iova`` is remaining from the old unions.
  The flag name ``MEMPOOL_F_NO_PHYS_CONTIG`` is removed,
  while the aliased flag ``MEMPOOL_F_NO_IOVA_CONTIG`` is kept.

* mbuf: Removed the functions ``rte_mbuf_data_dma_addr*``
  and the macros ``rte_pktmbuf_mtophys*``.
  The same functionality is still available with the functions and macros
  having ``iova`` in their names instead of ``dma_addr`` or ``mtophys``.

* mbuf: Removed the unioned field ``buf_physaddr`` from ``rte_mbuf``.
  The field ``buf_iova`` is remaining from the old union.

* mbuf: Removed the unioned field ``refcnt_atomic`` from
  the structures ``rte_mbuf`` and ``rte_mbuf_ext_shared_info``.
  The field ``refcnt`` is remaining from the old unions.

* pci: Removed the ``rte_kernel_driver`` enum defined in rte_dev.h and
  replaced with a private enum in the PCI subsystem.

* pci: Removed the PCI resources map API from the public API
  (``pci_map_resource`` and ``pci_unmap_resource``) and moved it to the
  PCI bus driver along with the PCI resources lists and associated structures
  (``pci_map``, ``pci_msix_table``, ``mapped_pci_resource`` and
  ``mapped_pci_res_list``).

* ethdev: Removed the ``kdrv`` field in the ethdev ``rte_eth_dev_data``
  structure as it gave no useful abstracted information to the applications.

* ethdev: ``rte_eth_rx_descriptor_done()`` API has been deprecated.

* Renamed internal ethdev APIs:

  * ``_rte_eth_dev_callback_process()`` -> ``rte_eth_dev_callback_process()``
  * ``_rte_eth_dev_reset`` -> ``rte_eth_dev_internal_reset()``

* ethdev: Modified field type of ``base`` and ``nb_queue`` in struct
  ``rte_eth_dcb_tc_queue_mapping`` from ``uint8_t`` to ``uint16_t``.
  As the data of ``uint8_t`` will be truncated when queue number under
  a TC is greater than 256.

* vhost: Moved vDPA APIs from experimental to stable.

* rawdev: Added a structure size parameter to the functions
  ``rte_rawdev_queue_setup()``, ``rte_rawdev_queue_conf_get()``,
  ``rte_rawdev_info_get()`` and ``rte_rawdev_configure()``,
  allowing limited driver type-checking and ABI compatibility.

* rawdev: Changed the return type of the function ``rte_dev_info_get()``
  and the function ``rte_rawdev_queue_conf_get()``
  from ``void`` to ``int`` allowing the return of error codes from drivers.

* rawdev: The running of a drivers ``selftest()`` function can now be done
  using the ``rawdev_autotest`` command in the ``dpdk-test`` binary. This
  command now calls the self-test function for each rawdev found on the
  system, and does not require a specific command per device type.
  Following this change, the ``ioat_rawdev_autotest`` command has been
  removed as no longer needed.

* raw/ioat: As noted above, the ``rte_ioat_do_copies()`` and
  ``rte_ioat_completed_copies()`` functions have been renamed to
  ``rte_ioat_perform_ops()`` and ``rte_ioat_completed_ops()`` respectively.

* stack: the experimental tag has been dropped from the stack library, and its
  interfaces are considered stable as of DPDK 20.11.

* bpf: ``RTE_BPF_XTYPE_NUM`` has been dropped from ``rte_bpf_xtype``.

* acl: ``RTE_ACL_CLASSIFY_NUM`` enum value has been removed.
  This enum value was not used inside DPDK, while it prevented to add new
  classify algorithms without causing an ABI breakage.

* sched: Added ``subport_profile_id`` as argument
  to function ``rte_sched_subport_config``.

* sched: Removed ``tb_rate``, ``tc_rate``, ``tc_period`` and ``tb_size``
  from ``struct rte_sched_subport_params``.

   =======================================================

* ``ethdev`` changes

  * Following device operation function pointers moved
    from ``struct eth_dev_ops`` to ``struct rte_eth_dev``:

    * ``eth_rx_queue_count_t       rx_queue_count;``
    * ``eth_rx_descriptor_done_t   rx_descriptor_done;``
    * ``eth_rx_descriptor_status_t rx_descriptor_status;``
    * ``eth_tx_descriptor_status_t tx_descriptor_status;``

  * ``struct eth_dev_ops`` is no more accessible by applications,
    which was already internal data structure.

  * ``ethdev`` internal functions are marked with ``__rte_internal`` tag.

* sched: Added new fields to ``struct rte_sched_subport_port_params``.
