DPDK Release 23.03
==================

.. **Read this first.**

   The text in the sections below explains how to update the release notes.

   Use proper spelling, capitalization and punctuation in all sections.

   Variable and config names should be quoted as fixed width text:
   ``LIKE_THIS``.

   Build the docs and view the output file to ensure the changes are correct::

New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

   * **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense.
     The description should be enough to allow someone scanning
     the release notes to understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)
     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs (ordered alphabetically by vendor name)
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)
       - etc
     * Other libs
     * Apps, Examples, Tools (if significant)

     =======================================================

* **Introduced lock annotations.**

  Added lock annotations attributes so that clang can statically analyze lock
  correctness.

* **Added support for reporting lcore usage in applications.**

  * The ``/eal/lcore/list``, ``/eal/lcore/usage`` and ``/eal/lcore/info``
    telemetry endpoints have been added to provide information similar to
    ``rte_lcore_dump()``.
  * Applications can register a callback at startup via
    ``rte_lcore_register_usage_cb()`` to provide lcore usage information.

* **Added flow matching of IPv6 routing extension.**

  Added ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_IPV6_ROUTING_EXT``
  to match IPv6 routing extension header fields.

* **Added flow matching of ICMPv6.**

  Added flow items to match ICMPv6 echo request and reply packets.
  Matching patterns can include ICMP identifier and sequence numbers.

* **Added flow flex handle to modify action.**

  Added flex modify item ``RTE_FLOW_FIELD_FLEX_ITEM``.

* **Added index-based rules insertion in flow API.**

  * Added ``rte_flow_table_insertion_type`` to allow the creation
    of index-based template tables in addition to pattern-based tables.
  * Introduced new function ``rte_flow_async_create_by_index()``
    to insert rules by index into index-based template tables.
  * Added hash calculation function used in template tables
    to allow control over the calculation of the rule index for a packet.

* **Added cross-port indirect action in asynchronous flow API.**

  * Allowed to share indirect actions between ports by passing
    the flag ``RTE_FLOW_PORT_FLAG_SHARE_INDIRECT`` to ``rte_flow_configure()``.
  * Added ``host_port_id`` in ``rte_flow_port_attr`` structure
    to reference the port hosting the shared objects.

* **Added support to skip congestion management configuration.**

  * Added a new action ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_SKIP_CMAN`` to skip
    congestion management processing based on per flow or packet color
    identified by rte_flow meter object

* **Updated AMD axgbe driver.**

  * Added multi-process support.

* **Updated Atomic Rules ark driver.**

  * Added Arkville FX2 device supporting PCIe Gen5x16.

* **Updated Corigine nfp driver.**

  * Added support for meter options.
  * Added support for rte_flow meter action.

* **Updated NVIDIA mlx5 driver.**

  * Added support for matching on ICMPv6 ID and sequence fields.

* **Updated Wangxun ngbe driver.**

  * Added chip overheat detection support.

* **Updated Wangxun txgbe driver.**

  * Added chip overheat detection support.
  * Added SFP hot-plug identification support.

* **Added new algorithms to cryptodev.**

  Added SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256 symmetric secure hash algorithm.

* **Updated Marvell cnxk crypto driver.**

  Added support for SHAKE hash algorithm in cn9k and cn10k.

* **Updated Intel QuickAssist Technology (QAT) crypto driver.**

  * Added support for SHA3 224/256/384/512 plain hash in QAT GEN 3.
  * Added support for SHA3 256 plain hash in QAT GEN 2.
  * Added support for asymmetric crypto in QAT GEN3.

* **Updated the eventdev reconfigure logic for service based adapters.**

  * eventdev reconfig logic is enhanced to increment the
    ``rte_event_dev_config::nb_single_link_event_port_queues`` parameter
    if event port config is of type ``RTE_EVENT_PORT_CFG_SINGLE_LINK``.
  * With this change, the application no longer needs to account for the
    ``rte_event_dev_config::nb_single_link_event_port_queues`` parameter
    required for eth_rx, eth_tx, crypto and timer eventdev adapters.

* **Added pcap trace support in graph library.**

  * Added support to capture packets at each graph node with packet metadata and
    node name.
