   =======================================================

* **Removed experimental performance thread example application.**


API Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain API changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the API change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".

     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* net: added experimental functions ``rte_ipv4_udptcp_cksum_mbuf()``,
  ``rte_ipv4_udptcp_cksum_mbuf_verify()``, ``rte_ipv6_udptcp_cksum_mbuf()``,
  ``rte_ipv6_udptcp_cksum_mbuf_verify()``

* ethdev: Old public macros and enumeration constants without ``RTE_ETH_`` prefix,
  which are kept for backward compatibility, are marked as deprecated.

* cryptodev: The asymmetric session handling was modified to use a single
  mempool object. An API ``rte_cryptodev_asym_session_pool_create`` was added
  to create a mempool with element size big enough to hold the generic asymmetric
  session header, max size for a device private session data, and user data size.
  The session structure was moved to ``cryptodev_pmd.h``,
  hiding it from applications.
  The API ``rte_cryptodev_asym_session_init`` was removed as the initialization
  is now moved to ``rte_cryptodev_asym_session_create``, which was updated to
  return an integer value to indicate initialisation errors.
