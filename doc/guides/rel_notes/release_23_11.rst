DPDK Release 23.11
==================

.. **Read this first.**

   The text in the sections below explains how to update the release notes.

   Use proper spelling, capitalization and punctuation in all sections.

   Variable and config names should be quoted as fixed width text:
   ``LIKE_THIS``.

   Build the docs and view the output file to ensure the changes are correct::

      ninja -C build doc
      xdg-open build/doc/guides/html/rel_notes/release_23_11.html

* Build Requirements: From DPDK 23.11 onwards,
  building DPDK will require a C compiler which supports the C11 standard,
  including support for C11 standard atomics.

  More specifically, the requirements will be:

  * Support for flag "-std=c11" (or similar)
  * __STDC_NO_ATOMICS__ is *not defined* when using c11 flag

  Please note:

  * C11, including standard atomics, is supported from GCC version 5 onwards,
    and is the default language version in that release
    (Ref: https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-5/changes.html)
  * C11 is the default compilation mode in Clang from version 3.6,
    which also added support for standard atomics
    (Ref: https://releases.llvm.org/3.6.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html)

New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

   * **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense.
     The description should be enough to allow someone scanning
     the release notes to understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)

       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)
       - etc
