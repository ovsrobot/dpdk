New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

     The description should be enough to allow someone scanning
     the release notes to understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)
     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)
       - etc
     * Other libs
     * Apps, Examples, Tools (if significant)

     This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
     Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
     =======================================================

  ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_MODIFY_FIELD``.
  Supported operations are: overwriting a field with the content from
  another field, addition and subtraction using an immediate value.

    ESN and anti-replay support.

  See the :doc:`../compressdevs/mlx5` for more details.

* **Added python script to run crypto perf tests and graph the results.**

  A new python script has been added to automate running crypto performance
  tests and output graphed results to PDF files.
  See the :doc:`../tools/cryptoperf` guide for more details.

* **Added support for build-time checking of header includes.**

  A new build option ``check_includes`` has been added, which, when enabled,
  will perform build-time checking on DPDK public header files, to ensure none
  are missing dependent header includes. This feature, disabled by default, is
  intended for use by developers contributing to the DPDK SDK itself, and is
  integrated into the build scripts and automated CI for patch contributions.


Removed Items
-------------

.. This section should contain removed items in this release. Sample format:

   * Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the removed item
     in the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* The internal header files ``rte_ethdev_driver.h``, ``rte_ethdev_vdev.h`` and
  ``rte_ethdev_pci.h`` are no longer installed as part of the DPDK
  ``ninja install`` action and are renamed to ``ethdev_driver.h``,
  ``ethdev_vdev.h`` and ``ethdev_pci.h`` respectively in the source tree, to
  reflect the fact that they are non-public headers.

* The internal header files ``rte_eventdev_pmd.h``, ``rte_eventdev_pmd_vdev.h``
  and ``rte_eventdev_pmd_pci.h`` are no longer installed as part of the DPDK
  ``ninja install`` action and are renamed to ``eventdev_pmd.h``,
  ``eventdev_pmd_vdev.h`` and ``eventdev_pmd_pci.h`` respectively in the source
  tree, to reflect the fact that they are non-public headers.

* Removed support for NetXtreme devices belonging to ``BCM573xx and
  BCM5740x`` families. Specifically the support for the following Broadcom
  PCI device IDs ``0x16c8, 0x16c9, 0x16ca, 0x16ce, 0x16cf, 0x16df, 0x16d0,``
  ``0x16d1, 0x16d2, 0x16d4, 0x16d5, 0x16e7, 0x16e8, 0x16e9`` has been removed.

* The ``check-includes.sh`` script for checking DPDK header files has been
  removed, being replaced by the ``check_includes`` build option described
  above.


API Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain API changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the API change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* config: Removed the old macros, included in ``rte_config.h``,
  to indicate which DPDK libraries and drivers are built.
  The new macros are generated by meson in a standardized format:
  ``RTE_LIB_<NAME>`` and ``RTE_<CLASS>_<NAME>``, where ``NAME`` is
  the upper-case component name, e.g. ``EAL``, ``ETHDEV``, ``VIRTIO``,
  and ``CLASS`` is the upper-case driver class, e.g. ``NET``, ``CRYPTO``.

* cryptodev: The structure ``rte_cryptodev`` has been updated with pointers
  for adding enqueue and dequeue callbacks.


ABI Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain ABI changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the ABI change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* No ABI change that would break compatibility with 20.11.

* The experimental function ``rte_telemetry_init`` has been removed from the
  public API and is now an internal-only function. Where telemetry library is
  available, it is called automatically from ``rte_eal_init()`` and so no end
  application need use it.

------------

.. This section should contain new known issues in this release. Sample format:

   * **Add title in present tense with full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the known issue
     in the present tense. Add information on any known workarounds.

   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

.. This section should contain a list of platforms that were tested
   with this release.

   The format is:

   * <vendor> platform with <vendor> <type of devices> combinations

     * List of CPU
     * List of OS
     * List of devices
     * Other relevant details...
