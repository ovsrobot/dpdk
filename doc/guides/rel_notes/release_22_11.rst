New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

   * **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense.
     The description should be enough to allow someone scanning
     the release notes to understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)
     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs (ordered alphabetically by vendor name)
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)
       - etc
     * Other libs
     * Apps, Examples, Tools (if significant)

   =======================================================

* eal: RTE_FUNC_PTR_OR_* macros have been marked deprecated and will be removed
  in the future. Applications can use ``devtools/cocci/func_or_ret.cocci``
  to update their code.

* bus: Registering a bus has been marked as an internal API.
  External users may still register their bus using the ``bus_driver.h``
  driver header (see ``enable_driver_sdk`` meson option).
  The ``rte_bus`` object is now opaque and must be manipulated through added
  accessors.

* drivers: Registering a driver on the ``auxiliary``, ``ifpga``, ``pci``,
  ``vdev``, ``vmbus`` buses has been marked as an internal API.
  External users may still register their driver using the associated driver
  headers (see ``enable_driver_sdk`` meson option).
  The ``rte_driver`` and ``rte_device`` objects are now opaque and must be
  manipulated through added accessors.

* ethdev: Removed deprecated macros. Applications can use ``devtools/cocci/namespace_ethdev.cocci``
  to update their code.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_LINK_SPEED_*``, ``ETH_SPEED_NUM_*`` and ``ETH_LINK_*``
    (duplex-related) defines.  Use corresponding defines with ``RTE_`` prefix
    instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_MQ_RX_*`` and ``ETH_MQ_TX_*`` defines.
    Use corresponding defines with ``RTE_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_RSS_*`` defines for hash function and
    RETA size specification. Use corresponding defines with ``RTE_`` prefix
    instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``DEV_RX_OFFLOAD_*`` and ``DEV_TX_OFFLOAD_``
    defines. Use corresponding defines with ``RTE_ETH_RX_OFFLOAD_`` and
    ``RTE_ETH_TX_OFFLOAD_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_DCB_*``, ``ETH_VMDQ_``, ``ETH_*_TCS``,
    ``ETH_*_POOLS`` and ``ETH_MAX_VMDQ_POOL`` defines. Use corresponding
    defines with ``RTE_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``RTE_TUNNEL_*`` defines. Use corresponding
    defines with ``RTE_ETH_TUNNEL_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``RTE_FC_*`` defines. Use corresponding
    defines with ``RTE_ETH_FC_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_VLAN_*`` and ``ETH_QINQ_`` defines.
    Use corresponding defines with ``RTE_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_NUM_RECEIVE_MAC_ADDR`` define.
    Use corresponding define with ``RTE_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``PKT_{R,T}X_DYNF_METADATA`` defines.
    Use corresponding defines ``RTE_MBUF_DYNFLAG_{R,T}X_METADATA`` instead.

* ethdev: Removed deprecated Flow Director configuration from device
  configuration (``dev_conf.fdir_conf``). Moved corresponding structures
  to internal API since some drivers still use it internally.

* raw/ifgpa: The function ``rte_pmd_ifpga_get_pci_bus`` has been removed.


ABI Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain ABI changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the ABI change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.
