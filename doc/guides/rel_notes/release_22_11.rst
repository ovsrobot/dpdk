   =======================================================

* eal: RTE_FUNC_PTR_OR_* macros have been marked deprecated and will be removed
  in the future. Applications can use ``devtools/cocci/func_or_ret.cocci``
  to update their code.

* eal: Updated ``rte_eal_remote_launch`` so it returns -EPIPE in case of
  a read or write error on the pipe, instead of calling ``rte_panic``.

* mempool: Deprecated helper macro ``MEMPOOL_HEADER_SIZE()`` is removed.
  The replacement macro ``RTE_MEMPOOL_HEADER_SIZE()`` is internal only.

* mempool: Deprecated macro to register mempool driver
  ``MEMPOOL_REGISTER_OPS()`` is removed. Use replacement macro
  ``RTE_MEMPOOL_REGISTER_OPS()`` instead.

* mempool: Deprecated macros ``MEMPOOL_PG_NUM_DEFAULT`` and
  ``MEMPOOL_PG_SHIFT_MAX`` are removed. These macros are not used and
  not required any more.

* mbuf: Removed deprecated ``PKT_*`` flags.
  Use corresponding flags with ``RTE_MBUF_F_`` prefix instead.
  Application can use ``devtools/cocci/prefix_mbuf_offload_flags.cocci``
  to replace all occurrences of old mbuf flags in C code.

* bus: Registering a bus has been marked as an internal API.
  External users may still register their bus using the ``bus_driver.h``
  driver header (see ``enable_driver_sdk`` meson option).
  The ``rte_bus`` object is now opaque and must be manipulated through added
  accessors.

* drivers: Registering a driver on the ``auxiliary``, ``ifpga``, ``pci``,
  ``vdev``, ``vmbus`` buses has been marked as an internal API.
  External users may still register their driver using the associated driver
  headers (see ``enable_driver_sdk`` meson option).
  The ``rte_driver`` and ``rte_device`` objects are now opaque and must be
  manipulated through added accessors.

* ethdev: Removed deprecated macros. Applications can use ``devtools/cocci/namespace_ethdev.cocci``
  to update their code.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_LINK_SPEED_*``, ``ETH_SPEED_NUM_*`` and ``ETH_LINK_*``
    (duplex-related) defines.  Use corresponding defines with ``RTE_`` prefix
    instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_MQ_RX_*`` and ``ETH_MQ_TX_*`` defines.
    Use corresponding defines with ``RTE_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_RSS_*`` defines for hash function and
    RETA size specification. Use corresponding defines with ``RTE_`` prefix
    instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``DEV_RX_OFFLOAD_*`` and ``DEV_TX_OFFLOAD_``
    defines. Use corresponding defines with ``RTE_ETH_RX_OFFLOAD_`` and
    ``RTE_ETH_TX_OFFLOAD_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_DCB_*``, ``ETH_VMDQ_``, ``ETH_*_TCS``,
    ``ETH_*_POOLS`` and ``ETH_MAX_VMDQ_POOL`` defines. Use corresponding
    defines with ``RTE_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``RTE_TUNNEL_*`` defines. Use corresponding
    defines with ``RTE_ETH_TUNNEL_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``RTE_FC_*`` defines. Use corresponding
    defines with ``RTE_ETH_FC_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_VLAN_*`` and ``ETH_QINQ_`` defines.
    Use corresponding defines with ``RTE_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_NUM_RECEIVE_MAC_ADDR`` define.
    Use corresponding define with ``RTE_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``PKT_{R,T}X_DYNF_METADATA`` defines.
    Use corresponding defines ``RTE_MBUF_DYNFLAG_{R,T}X_METADATA`` instead.

* ethdev: Removed deprecated Flow Director configuration from device
  configuration (``dev_conf.fdir_conf``). Moved corresponding structures
  to internal API since some drivers still use it internally.

* ethdev: Promoted ``rte_eth_rx_metadata_negotiate()``
  from experimental to stable.

* ethdev: Promoted the following flow primitives
  from experimental to stable:

  - ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_PORT_REPRESENTOR``
  - ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_REPRESENTED_PORT``
  - ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_PORT_REPRESENTOR``
  - ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_REPRESENTED_PORT``

* ethdev: Promoted ``rte_flow_pick_transfer_proxy()``
  from experimental to stable.

* cryptodev: The structure ``rte_cryptodev_sym_session`` was made internal.
  The API ``rte_cryptodev_sym_session_init`` and ``rte_cryptodev_sym_session_clear``
  were removed and user would only need to call ``rte_cryptodev_sym_session_create``
  and ``rte_cryptodev_sym_session_free`` to create/destroy sessions.
  The API ``rte_cryptodev_sym_session_create`` was updated to take a single mempool
  with element size big enough to hold session data and session private data.
  All sample applications were updated to attach an opaque pointer for the session
  to the ``rte_crypto_op`` while enqueuing.

* security: MACsec support is added which resulted in updates
  to structures ``rte_security_macsec_xform``, ``rte_security_macsec_stats``
  and security capability structure ``rte_security_capability``
  to accommodate MACsec capabilities.

* security: The experimental API ``rte_security_get_userdata`` was being unused
  by most of the drivers and it was retrieving userdata from mbuf dynamic field.
  The API is now removed and the application can directly get the userdata from
  mbuf dynamic field.

* eventdev: The function ``rte_event_crypto_adapter_queue_pair_add`` was updated
  to accept configuration of type ``rte_event_crypto_adapter_queue_conf``
  instead of ``rte_event``,
  similar to ``rte_event_eth_rx_adapter_queue_add`` signature.
  Event will be one of the configuration fields,
  together with additional vector parameters.

* metrics: Updated ``rte_metrics_init`` so it returns an error code instead
  of calling ``rte_exit``.

* telemetry: The allowed characters in names for dictionary values
  are now limited to alphanumeric characters and a small subset of additional
  printable characters.
  This will ensure that all dictionary parameter names can be output
  without escaping in JSON - or in any future output format used.
  Names for the telemetry commands are now similarly limited.
  The parameters for telemetry commands are unaffected by this change.

* raw/ifgpa: The function ``rte_pmd_ifpga_get_pci_bus`` has been removed.

-----------

.. This section should contain ABI changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the ABI change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.

   =======================================================

* eal: Updated EAL thread names from ``lcore-worker-<lcore_id>`` to
  ``rte-worker-<lcore_id>`` so that DPDK can accommodate lcores higher than 99.

* ethdev: enum ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM`` was affected by deprecation procedure.

* ethdev: enum ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION`` was affected by deprecation procedure.

* eventdev: Added ``evtim_drop_count`` field
