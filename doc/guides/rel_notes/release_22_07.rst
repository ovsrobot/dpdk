New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

   * **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense.
     The description should be enough to allow someone scanning
     the release notes to understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)
     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs (ordered alphabetically by vendor name)
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)
       - etc
     * Other libs
     * Apps, Examples, Tools (if significant)

     This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
     Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
     =======================================================

* **Added initial RISC-V architecture support.***

  Added EAL implementation for RISC-V architecture.
  The initial device the porting was tested on is
  a HiFive Unmatched development board based on the SiFive Freedom U740 SoC.
  In theory this implementation should work
  with any ``rv64gc`` ISA compatible implementation
  with MMU supporting a reasonable address space size (U740 uses sv39 MMU).

* **Added Sequence Lock.**

  Added a new synchronization primitive: the sequence lock
  (seqlock). A seqlock allows for low overhead, parallel reads. The
  DPDK seqlock uses a spinlock to serialize multiple writing threads.

* ** Added function get random floating point number.**

  Added the function ``rte_drand()`` to provide a pseudo-random
  floating point number.

* **Added protocol based input color selection for meter.**

  Added new functions ``rte_mtr_color_in_protocol_set()``,
  ``rte_mtr_color_in_protocol_get()``,
  ``rte_mtr_color_in_protocol_priority_get()``,
  ``rte_mtr_meter_vlan_table_update()``
  and updated ``struct rte_mtr_params`` and ``struct rte_mtr_capabilities`` to
  support protocol based input color selection for meter.

* **Added Rx queue available descriptors threshold and event.**

  available descriptors threshold and query for queues with reached
  threshold when a new event ``RTE_ETH_EVENT_RX_AVAIL_THRESH`` is received.

  Added telemetry command to dump module EEPROM.
  Added support for module EEPROM information format defined in:
