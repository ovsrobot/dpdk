New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

   * **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense.
     The description should be enough to allow someone scanning
     the release notes to understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)
     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs (ordered alphabetically by vendor name)
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)
       - etc
     * Other libs
     * Apps, Examples, Tools (if significant)

     This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
     Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
     =======================================================

* **Added initial RISC-V architecture support.***

  Added EAL implementation for RISC-V architecture.
  The initial device the porting was tested on is
  a HiFive Unmatched development board based on the SiFive Freedom U740 SoC.
  In theory this implementation should work
  with any ``rv64gc`` ISA compatible implementation
  with MMU supporting a reasonable address space size (U740 uses sv39 MMU).

* **Added Sequence Lock.**

  Added a new synchronization primitive: the sequence lock
  (seqlock). A seqlock allows for low overhead, parallel reads. The
  DPDK seqlock uses a spinlock to serialize multiple writing threads.

* **Added protocol based input color selection for meter.**

  Added new functions ``rte_mtr_color_in_protocol_set()``,
  ``rte_mtr_color_in_protocol_get()``,
  ``rte_mtr_color_in_protocol_priority_get()``,
  ``rte_mtr_meter_vlan_table_update()``
  and updated ``struct rte_mtr_params`` and ``struct rte_mtr_capabilities`` to
  support protocol based input color selection for meter.

* **Added Rx queue available descriptors threshold and event.**

  Added ethdev API and corresponding driver operations to set Rx queue
  available descriptors threshold and query for queues with reached
  threshold when a new event ``RTE_ETH_EVENT_RX_AVAIL_THRESH`` is received.

* **Added telemetry for module EEPROM.**

  Added telemetry command to dump module EEPROM.
  Added support for module EEPROM information format defined in:

    * SFF-8079 revision 1.7
    * SFF-8472 revision 12.0
    * SFF-8636 revision 2.7

* **Added vhost API to get the number of in-flight packets.**

  Added an API which can get the number of in-flight packets in
  vhost async data path without using lock.

* **Added vhost async dequeue API to receive packets from guest.**

  Added vhost async dequeue API which can leverage DMA devices to
  accelerate receiving packets from guest.

* **Added vhost API to get the device type of a vDPA device.**

  Added an API which can get the device type of vDPA device.

* **Updated Amazon ena driver.**

  The new driver version (v2.7.0) includes:

  * Added fast mbuf free feature support.
  * Added ``enable_llq`` device argument for controlling the PMD LLQ
    (Low Latency Queue) mode.

* **Updated Atomic Rules' Arkville PMD.**

  * A firmware version update to Arkville 22.07 is required.
  * Added support for Atomic Rules PCI device IDs ``0x101a, 0x101b, 0x101c``.
  * Added PMD support for virtual functions and vfio_pci driver.

* **Updated Intel iavf driver.**

  * Added Tx QoS queue rate limitation support.
  * Added quanta size configuration support.
  * Added ``DEV_RX_OFFLOAD_TIMESTAMP`` support.
  * Added Protocol Agnostic Flow Offloading support in AVF FDIR and RSS.

* **Updated Intel ice driver.**

 * Added support for RSS RETA configure in DCF mode.
 * Added support for RSS HASH configure in DCF mode.
 * Added support for MTU configure in DCF mode.
 * Added support for promisc configuration in DCF mode.
 * Added support for MAC configuration in DCF mode.
 * Added support for VLAN filter and offload configuration in DCF mode.
 * Added Tx QoS queue / queue group rate limitation configure support.
 * Added Tx QoS queue / queue group priority configuration support.
 * Added Tx QoS queue weight configuration support.

* **Updated Intel igc driver.**

  Added Intel Foxville I226 devices in ``igc`` driver.
  See the doc:`../nics/igc` NIC guide for more details.

* **Updated Mellanox mlx5 driver.**

  * Added support for promiscuous mode on Windows.
  * Added support for MTU on Windows.
  * Added matching and RSS on IPsec ESP.

* **Updated VMware vmxnet3 networking driver.**

  * Added version 5 support.
  * Added RETA query and RETA update support.
  * Added version 6 support with some new features:

    * Increased maximum MTU up to 9190;
    * Increased maximum number of Rx and Tx queues;
    * Removed power-of-two limitations on Rx and Tx queue size;
    * Extended interrupt structures (required for additional queues).

* **Updated Wangxun ngbe driver.**

  * Added support for yt8531s PHY.

* **Added Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) algorithm in cryptodev.**

  Added support for Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) asymmetric
  algorithm in cryptodev.

* **Updated Marvell cnxk crypto driver.**

  * Added AH mode support in lookaside protocol (IPsec) for CN9K & CN10K.
  * Added AES-GMAC support in lookaside protocol (IPsec) for CN9K & CN10K.

* **Updated Intel QuickAssist Technology (QAT) crypto PMD.**

  * Added support for secp384r1 elliptic curve.

* **Added eventdev API to quiesce an event port.**

  Added the function ``rte_event_port_quiesce()``
  to quiesce any lcore-specific resources consumed by the event port,
  when the lcore is no more associated with an event port.

* **Added support for setting queue attributes at runtime in eventdev.**

  Added new API ``rte_event_queue_attr_set()``, to set event queue attributes
  at runtime.

* **Added new queues attributes weight and affinity in eventdev.**

  Defined new event queue attributes weight and affinity as below:

  * ``RTE_EVENT_QUEUE_ATTR_WEIGHT``
  * ``RTE_EVENT_QUEUE_ATTR_AFFINITY``

* **Added telemetry to dmadev library.**

  Added telemetry callback functions which allow for a list of DMA devices,
  statistics and other DMA device information to be queried.

* **Added scalar version of the LPM library.**

  Added scalar implementation of ``rte_lpm_lookupx4``.
  This is a fall-back implementation for platforms that
  don't support vector operations.

* **Merged l3fwd-acl into l3fwd example.**

  Merged l3fwd-acl code into l3fwd as l3fwd-acl contains duplicate
  and common functions to l3fwd.

* **Update Openssl PMD with 3.0 EVP API.**

  Update Openssl PMD deprecated APIs to EVP APIs where supported in Openssl
  3.0 lib.
