==================

.. **Read this first.**

   Use proper spelling, capitalization and punctuation in all sections.

   Variable and config names should be quoted as fixed width text:
   ``LIKE_THIS``.

   Build the docs and view the output file to ensure the changes are correct::

New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

   * **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense.
     The description should be enough to allow someone scanning
     the release notes to understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)
     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs (ordered alphabetically by vendor name)
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)
       - etc
     * Other libs
     * Apps, Examples, Tools (if significant)

     =======================================================

* **New configuration settings for Rx and Tx Ethernet Queues.**

   New defines have been added to DPDK to allow independent tracking of the maximum number of Rx and Tx queues.
   These defines are ``RTE_MAX_ETHPORT_RX_QUEUES`` and ``RTE_MAX_ETHPORT_TX_QUEUES``,
   and these new defines should be used in place of the older define ``RTE_MAX_QUEUES_PER_PORT``.
   Unlike the older define, these new defines are build-time configurable via meson options:
   ``max_ethport_rx_queues`` and ``max_ethport_tx_queues``.

.. note::

   The default max values for Rx and Tx queue limits are reduced from 1024, in previous releases,
   to 256 in this release.
   For application that require large numbers of queues,
   these defaults can be changed via the meson configuration options described above.
