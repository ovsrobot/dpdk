New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

   * **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense.
     The description should be enough to allow someone scanning
     the release notes to understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)
     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs (ordered alphabetically by vendor name)
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)
       - etc
     * Other libs
     * Apps, Examples, Tools (if significant)

     =======================================================

* **Added HiSilicon UACCE bus support.**

  UACCE (Unified/User-space-access-intended Accelerator Framework) bus driver

  be further registered such as a compress, crypto, DMA and ethernet devices.

* **Introduced argument parsing library.**

  The argparse library was added to ease writing user-friendly applications,
  replacing ``getopt()`` usage.

  Added new function ``rte_eth_find_rss_algo``
  to get RSS hash algorithm by its name.

* **Added query of used descriptors number in Tx queue.**

  * Added a fath path function ``rte_eth_tx_queue_count``
    to get the number of used descriptors of a Tx queue.

  Added function to calculate hash when doing tunnel encapsulation:
  ``rte_flow_calc_encap_hash()``

* **Added flow matching items.**

  * Added ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_COMPARE`` to allow matching
    on comparison result between packet fields or value.
  * Added ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_RANDOM`` to match a random value,
    and ``RTE_FLOW_FIELD_RANDOM`` to represent it with a field ID.

* **Added flow template table resizing.**

  * ``RTE_FLOW_TABLE_SPECIALIZE_RESIZABLE_TABLE`` table configuration bit.
    Set at table creation to allow future resizing.
  * ``rte_flow_template_table_resizable()``.
    Query whether template table can be resized.
  * ``rte_flow_template_table_resize()``.
    Reconfigure template table for new flows capacity.
  * ``rte_flow_async_update_resized()``.
    Reconfigure flows for the updated table configuration.
  * ``rte_flow_template_table_resize_complete()``.
    Complete table resize.

* **Updated Atomic Rules' Arkville driver.**

  * Added support for Atomic Rules' TK242 packet-capture family of devices
    with PCI IDs: ``0x1024, 0x1025, 0x1026``.

* **Updated Marvell cnxk net driver.**

* **Updated Marvell OCTEON EP driver.**

  * Optimized mbuf rearm sequence.
  * Updated Tx queue mbuf free thresholds from 128 to 256 for better performance.
  * Updated Rx queue mbuf refill routine to use mempool alloc and reorder it
    to avoid mbuf write commits.
  * Added optimized SSE Rx routines.
  * Added optimized AVX2 Rx routines.
  * Added optimized NEON Rx routines.

* **Updated NVIDIA mlx5 driver.**

  * Added support for VXLAN-GPE matching in DV and HWS flow engines.
  * Added support for GENEVE matching and modifying in HWS flow engine.
  * Added support for modifying IPv4 proto field in HWS flow engine.
  * Added support for modifying IPsec ESP fields in HWS flow engine.
  * Added support for matching a random value.
  * Added support for comparing result between packet fields or value.
  * Added support for accumulating value of field into another one.

* **Updated Marvell cnxk crypto driver.**

  * Added support for Rx inject in crypto_cn10k.
  * Added support for TLS record processing in crypto_cn10k
    to support TLS v1.2, TLS v1.3 and DTLS v1.2.
  * Added PMD API to allow raw submission of instructions to CPT.

  * **Added support for dumping registers with names and filter.**

    * Added new API functions ``rte_eth_dev_get_reg_info_ext()`` to and filter

Removed Items
-------------

.. This section should contain removed items in this release. Sample format:

   * Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the removed item
     in the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* log: Removed the statically defined logtypes that were used internally by DPDK.
  All code should be using the dynamic logtypes (see ``RTE_LOG_REGISTER()``).
  The application reserved statically defined logtypes ``RTE_LOGTYPE_USER1..RTE_LOGTYPE_USER8``
  are still defined.


API Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain API changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the API change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* eal: Removed ``typeof(type)`` from the expansion of ``RTE_DEFINE_PER_LCORE``
  and ``RTE_DECLARE_PER_LCORE`` macros aligning them with their intended design.
  If use with an expression is desired applications can adapt by supplying
  ``typeof(e)`` as an argument.

* eal: Improved ``RTE_BUILD_BUG_ON`` by using C11 ``static_assert``.
  Non-constant expressions are now rejected instead of being silently ignored.

* gso: ``rte_gso_segment`` now returns -ENOTSUP for unknown protocols.

* ethdev: Renamed structure ``rte_flow_action_modify_data`` to be
  ``rte_flow_field_data`` for more generic usage.


ABI Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain ABI changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the ABI change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =======================================================

* No ABI change that would break compatibility with 23.11.

* ethdev: Added ``filter`` and ``names`` fields to ``rte_dev_reg_info``
  structure for reporting names of registers and filtering them by names.


Known Issues
------------

.. This section should contain new known issues in this release. Sample format:

   * **Add title in present tense with full stop.**
