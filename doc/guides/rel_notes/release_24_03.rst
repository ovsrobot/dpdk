New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

   * **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense.
     The description should be enough to allow someone scanning
     the release notes to understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)
     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs (ordered alphabetically by vendor name)
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)
       - etc
     * Other libs
     * Apps, Examples, Tools (if significant)

     This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
     Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.

   =======================================================

* log: Removed the statically defined logtypes that were used internally by DPDK.
  All code should be using the dynamic logtypes (see ``RTE_LOG_REGISTER()``).
  The application reserved statically defined logtypes ``RTE_LOGTYPE_USER1..RTE_LOGTYPE_USER8``
  are still defined.

* acc101: Removed obsolete code for non productized HW variant.


API Changes
-----------

     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.

   =======================================================

* eal: Removed ``typeof(type)`` from the expansion of ``RTE_DEFINE_PER_LCORE``
  and ``RTE_DECLARE_PER_LCORE`` macros aligning them with their intended design.
  If use with an expression is desired applications can adapt by supplying
  ``typeof(e)`` as an argument.

* eal: Improved ``RTE_BUILD_BUG_ON`` by using C11 ``static_assert``.
  Non-constant expressions are now rejected instead of being silently ignored.

* gso: ``rte_gso_segment`` now returns -ENOTSUP for unknown protocols.

* ethdev: Renamed structure ``rte_flow_action_modify_data`` to be
  ``rte_flow_field_data`` for more generic usage.


ABI Changes
-----------
