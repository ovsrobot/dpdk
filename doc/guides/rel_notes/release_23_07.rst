==================

.. **Read this first.**

   The text in the sections below explains how to update the release notes.

   Use proper spelling, capitalization and punctuation in all sections.

   Variable and config names should be quoted as fixed width text:
   ``LIKE_THIS``.

   Build the docs and view the output file to ensure the changes are correct::

New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

   * **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense.
     The description should be enough to allow someone scanning
     the release notes to understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)
     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs (ordered alphabetically by vendor name)
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)
       - etc
     * Other libs
     * Apps, Examples, Tools (if significant)

     This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.

     =======================================================

* **Added AMD CDX bus support.**

  CDX bus driver has been added to support AMD CDX bus,
  which operates on FPGA based CDX devices.
  The CDX devices are memory mapped on system bus for embedded CPUs.

* **Added MMIO read and write API to PCI bus.**

  Introduced ``rte_pci_mmio_read()`` and ``rte_pci_mmio_write()`` API
  to PCI bus so that PCI drivers can access PCI memory resources
  when they are not mapped to process address space.

* **Added ethdev Rx/Tx queue ID check API.**

  Added ethdev Rx/Tx queue ID check API.
  If the queue has been setup, it is considered valid.

* **Added LLRS FEC mode in ethdev.**

  Added LLRS algorithm to Forward Error Correction (FEC) modes.

* **Added flow matching of Tx queue.**

  Added ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_TX_QUEUE`` rte_flow pattern
  to match the Tx queue of the sent packet.

* **Added flow matching of Infiniband BTH.**

  Added ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_IB_BTH`` to match Infiniband BTH fields.

* **Added actions to push or remove IPv6 extension.**

  Added ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_IPV6_EXT_PUSH`` and ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_IPV6_EXT_PUSH``
  to push or remove the specific IPv6 extension into or from the packets.
  Push always put the new extension as the last one due to the next header awareness.

* **Added indirect list flow action.**

  Added API to manage (create, destroy, update) a list of indirect actions.

* **Added flow rule update.**

  * Added API for updating the action list in the already existing rule.
    Introduced both ``rte_flow_actions_update()`` and
    ``rte_flow_async_actions_update()`` functions.

* **Added vhost callback API for interrupt handling.**

  A new callback, ``guest_notify``, is introduced that can be used to handle
  the interrupt kick outside of the datapath fast path.
  In addition, a new API, ``rte_vhost_notify_guest()``,
  is added to raise the interrupt outside of the fast path.

* **Added vhost API to set maximum queue pairs supported.**

  Introduced ``rte_vhost_driver_set_max_queue_num()`` to be able to limit
  the maximum number of supported queue pairs, required for VDUSE support.

* **Added VDUSE support into vhost library.**

  VDUSE aims at implementing vDPA devices in userspace.
  It can be used as an alternative to Vhost-user when using Vhost-vDPA,
  but also enable providing a virtio-net netdev to the host
  when using Virtio-vDPA driver.
  A limitation in this release is the lack of reconnection support.
  While VDUSE support is already available in upstream kernel,
  a couple of patches are required to support network device type,
  which are being upstreamed:
  https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230419134329.346825-1-maxime.coquelin@redhat.com/

* **Updated NVIDIA mlx5 driver.**

  * Added support for multi-packet receive queue (MPRQ) on Windows.
  * Added support for CQE compression on Windows.
  * Added support for enhanced multi-packet write on Windows.
  * Added support for quota flow action and item.

* **Added vmxnet3 version 7 support.**

  Added support for vmxnet3 version 7 which includes support
  for uniform passthrough(UPT). The patches also add support
  for new capability registers, large passthrough BAR and some
  performance enhancements for UPT.

* **Added new algorithms to cryptodev.**

  * Added asymmetric algorithm ShangMi 2 (SM2) along with prime field curve support.
  * Added symmetric hash algorithm SM3-HMAC.
  * Added symmetric cipher algorithm ShangMi 4 (SM4) in CFB and OFB modes.

* **Updated Intel QuickAssist Technology (QAT) crypto driver.**

  * Added support for combined Cipher-CRC offload for DOCSIS for QAT GENs 2,3 and 4.
  * Added support for SM3-HMAC algorithm for QAT GENs 3 and 4.

* **Updated Marvell cnxk crypto driver.**

  * Added support for PDCP chain in cn10k crypto driver.
  * Added support for SM3 hash operations.
  * Added support for AES-CCM in cn9k and cn10k drivers.

* **Updated OpenSSL crypto driver.**

  * Added SM2 algorithm support in asymmetric crypto operations.

* **Added PDCP Library.**

  Added an experimental library to provide PDCP UL and DL processing of packets.

  The library supports all PDCP algorithms
  and leverages lookaside crypto offloads to cryptodevs for crypto processing.
  PDCP features such as IV generation, sequence number handling, etc are supported.
  It is planned to add more features such as packet caching in future releases.

  See :doc:`../prog_guide/pdcp_lib` for more information.
