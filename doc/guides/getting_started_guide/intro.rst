Introduction
============

Welcome to the getting started guide for the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) covering Linux, 
FreeBSD, and Windows. DPDK is a set of libraries and drivers that accelerate packet processing 
and allow the user to create high-performance networking applications.

The guide is structured to provide basic step-by-step instructions with OS-specific instructions included only where necessary for each operating system. 
By the end of this guide, you should have a solid understanding of how to implement
and use DPDK in your networking projects, regardless of the operating system you are using.
