Event Handling
==============

The ``testpmd`` application supports following two type event handling:

ethdev events
-------------

The ``testpmd`` provide options "--print-event" and "--mask-event" to control
whether display such as "Port x y event" when received "y" event on port "x".
This is named as default processing.

This section details the support events, unless otherwise specified, only the
default processing is support.

- ``RTE_ETH_EVENT_INTR_LSC``:
  If device started with lsc enabled, the PMD will launch this event when it
  detect link status changes.

- ``RTE_ETH_EVENT_QUEUE_STATE``:
  Used only within vhost PMD to report vring whether enabled.

- ``RTE_ETH_EVENT_INTR_RESET``:
  Used to report reset interrupt happened, this event only reported when the
  PMD supports ``RTE_ETH_ERROR_HANDLE_MODE_PASSIVE``.

- ``RTE_ETH_EVENT_VF_MBOX``:
  Used as a PF to process mailbox messages of the VFs to which the PF belongs.

- ``RTE_ETH_EVENT_INTR_RMV``:
  Used to report device removal event. The ``testpmd`` will remove the port
  later.

- ``RTE_ETH_EVENT_NEW``:
  Used to report port was probed event. The ``testpmd`` will setup the port
  later.

- ``RTE_ETH_EVENT_DESTROY``:
